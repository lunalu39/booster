Based on the “Boosting Felsenstein Phylogenetic Bootstrap” by Lemoine et. al., the functions in this package are used to compute the transfer bootstrap values for the evolutionary trees.

To use this package, you can install the source file and "Build and Reload" in R studio. Then you can use the functions in the package to compute the transfer bootstrap values.
